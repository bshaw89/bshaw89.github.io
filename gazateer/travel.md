Travel in the Valelands is done mainly by road, on horseback.

### The North Road
There is one main road which extends from south to north through the valley. Where it passes, folk who live near are charged with its upkeep and protection. It is
generally well kept, though in some stretches better than others. Armies use the road when on march, while bandits prowl lesser side roads and trails. 

Travelling the North Road is the safest way to cross the valley, though travellers will pass watchposts, making it difficult to avoid notice.

### Signal Fires
Settlements communicate with each other using a network of signal fires spanning the length of the valley. The fires are used as a warning when enemies
are on the road.
