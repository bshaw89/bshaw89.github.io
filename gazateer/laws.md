On the laws which govern these lands.

### _The Law of Blades_
To wield named steel is reserved for those of noble birth. Common soldiers, hedge knights, and the bastard children of nobles must wield unnamed steel or suffer dishonour to their clan, and punishments up to and including death.

### _The Law of Oaths_
To swear an oath is a sacred act of honour. Any true oath bloodsworn to another must be held or else the swearer be cast out from hall and made outlaw.
