### Full Harness
A knight's equippage, or _harness_, is vital to survival and success in combat. 
Harness is extremely expensive, requring some thousands of gold pieces to craft and some hundreds to maintain.
Harness must be made custom for the wearer, and a full suit typically will include the following pieces, donned in order:

1. **Hose and arming jacket**. Hose for the legs. The arming jacket must never be washed or it will change shape and no longer fit.
2. **Cloth coif**. Comfort for the skull beneath the helmet.
3. **Grieves**. Shin and calf protection.
4. **Cuisse**. Protection for the upper leg and knee.
5. **Mail skirt**. Protection for the groin.
6. **Breastplate**. For the chest and upper ribs.
7. **Placart**. For the stomach and ribs. Fits over the breastplate.
8. **Tassets**. Hanging flaps of armour protecting the waist from upward thrusts beneath the placart.
9. **Vambraces**. Cylindrical armour for the forearms.
10. **Cannons**. Protection for the upper arms. One side is typically bigger (non-dominant arm).
11. **Pauldrons**. Large rounded pieces for the shoulders.
12. **Bevor**. For the neck.
13. **Helmet**. Visored or visorless. Knight's choice.

_**You are wearing all of this.**_

### Donning the Armour
A knight cannot don harness alone. A servant or companion must aid in the effort, tying knots, tightening straps, and connecting pegs. 
It takes an experienced squire at least 5 minutes to fully armour a knight. It takes 1 minute for the knight to doff the armour.

### Other Armour
Suits of chainmail or leather, plus helmet, are worn by poor knights and common soldiers. They offer far less protection but are much cheaper to make.
Some wealthy lords are able to provide their soldiers or vassal knights with breastplates, if not full harness.

### Acquiring Harness
After coming of age, a sufficiently wealthy knight will have a full harness made to measure. A poor knight from a once wealthy family can inherit harness
from a relative, though it will usually be ill fitting. Munitions harness is available to buy from some few smiths who can afford to forge stock, but 
it is of lesser quality and not made to measure. These smiths are typically of lesser skill, unable to acquire many commissions from wealthy knights.

### Repairing Harness
Damage to the harness must be repaired to maintain its effectiveness. These repairs must be carried out by a sufficiently skilled smith. For this reason,
knights who can afford it will usually keep a smith with them when travelling.
