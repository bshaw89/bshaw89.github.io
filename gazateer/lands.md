Herein lies the records of the lands of the valley.

The valley is divided into three realms. The central realm, Grolje, is controlled by a dark sorcerer whose creations and influence make travel between the northlands and southlands dangerous.

### Grolje
_Land of Stalking Shadows_

Once home to the Groljen, people of the wood, the sorcerer tyrant Yirge pushed them out by recruiting corruptible men and creating unholy beasts to stalk the forests. Now the remaining Groljen guard the wood, doing constant battle with Yirge's followers and monstrous creations and protecting the Highroad. Yirge is rumoured to be hundreds of years old, having someohow overcome mortal aging.

### Church of the Sapphire Rose
An order of knights devoted to the Sapphire Rose, an ideal of purity, justice, and the 'romantic good.'
Their symbol is a blue rose.

### Order of the Twilight Sun
An order of knights dedicated to protecting the land from dark, recording history, and keeping light burning through the night.
Their symbol is a church on a hill against a sunset.
